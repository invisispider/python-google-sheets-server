# Flask Server with User Database + Google Sheets Integration

This project is a **template web application** that sets up:  
‚úÖ **A Python Flask server**  
‚úÖ **Google Sheets API integration (with OAuth)**  
‚úÖ **An SQLite3 user login + registration system**  

It‚Äôs designed as a fast-start boilerplate to connect a basic Python server with Google Workspace tools ‚Äî letting you extend it into custom dashboards, automations, or data-driven apps.

- Reads and writes spreadsheet data in real time  
- Simple SQLite3-backed login and user management  
- Flask REST endpoints (separating backend and frontend)  
- Clear error flashing and feedback in the UI  
- Easily extendable (future: React frontend integration.)

## üõ† Notes

- Current setup is configured for local development; production (using WSGI) is commented out and will need adjustments.  
- Only test users (added in Google Cloud) can bypass app verification for unverified scopes.  
- Example Flask routes include:
`/authorize`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/users`, `/weekly-check`, `/sheets-json`

## üíº Freelance Applications

I build or adapt **custom solutions like this** for small teams who:  
- Juggle data across Google Sheets, CRMs, or ERPs  
- Need **automated** dashboards or reports    
- Want a clean, intuitive web interface to monitor KPIs and insights  

If you‚Äôre wasting time on manual data work, I can help streamline and automate your process.
